# Tripadvisor

This project is a simplified Tripadvisor clone built using only HTML and CSS. It aims to replicate the basic structure and appearance of the popular travel website Tripadvisor, with a strong focus on layout and styling using Flexbox and CSS positioning.

The project showcases a home page with:

A navigation bar with links to Hotels, Restaurants, and Attractions.

A visually engaging hero section with a background image and overlay text.

A cards section displaying top hotel, restaurant, and attraction options using Flexbox for responsive layout.

A minimal footer styled to match the brand tone.

This project was developed without JavaScript to focus on mastering layout techniques using modern CSS features like Flexbox and position: relative/absolute/sticky.
